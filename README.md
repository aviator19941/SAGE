SAGE Project web scraping in Python 3
Used the requests library and BeatifulSoup as a web scraping tool to scrape the Orbital Launches Wikipedia page in the year 2019.

Need to install requests, BeautifulSoup, and dateutil and lxml libraries in order to run script without any errors.

Output is test.csv as a csv file with the ISO 8601 date and the number of 'Successful', 'Operational', or 'En Route' orbital launches in 2019.
